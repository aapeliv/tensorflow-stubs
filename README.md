# tensorflow-stubs: experimental typing stubs for tensorflow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/persephone-tools/tensorflow-stubs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/persephone-tools/tensorflow-stubs)

This repository exists for developing [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/)
compatible typing annotations for [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).

This package is called "tensorflow-stubs" in compliance with [PEP
561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/). This allows work to be done on the type
annotations from outside the tensorflow library as tensorflow currently does not have
type annotations.

Please note: *This is very much a work in progress*, pull requests are very welcome!
